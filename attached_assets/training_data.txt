About the Computer Science Program
        The Computer Science Program provides students with fundamental computer science knowledge and training, and prepares them to apply their knowledge and training to produce solutions to specific problems. Students learn to define a problem clearly, determine its feasibility and choose an appropriate solution strategy. The solution strategy will study, specify, design, implement, test, modify, and document the solution. As part of the solution strategy, students will learn to evaluate alternative designs, perform risk analysis on alternative designs, and finally, communicate solutions to colleagues and other professionals. A key element to all of this is the ability of the student to work and collaborate within a team environment throughout the entire problem-solving process.
        Primary Objective of the Computer Science Curriculum
        Provide practical knowledge that will be of immediate use in the profession.
        Provide a solid foundation in theoretical computer science, so that graduates will have the fundamentals necessary to acquire knowledge in a rapidly evolving discipline.
        Bachelor of Computer Science degree students learning outcomes
        Analyze a complex computing problem and to apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions.
        Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program’s discipline.
        Communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts.
        Recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in computing practice based on legal and ethical principles.
        Function effectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities appropriate to the program discipline.
        Apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing-based solutions.
        Areas of Learning Focus
        Software Engineering, Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Cryptography, Data Science, Game/Robotics, Quantum Computing, Cloud Computing. 
        The Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Computer Science
        The undergraduate program in Computer Science prepares students for entry into the computing profession, for graduate study in computer, computational, and data sciences, and for the many challenges that will confront them in their professional and personal life. The Computer Science program also prepares students to apply their knowledge and training to produce solutions to specific and esoteric problems. Students learn to define the problem clearly; to determine its tractability; to determine when consultation with outside experts is appropriate; to evaluate and choose an appropriate solution strategy; and then to study, specify, design, implement, test, modify, and document that solution; to evaluate alternatives and perform risk analysis on that design; to integrate alternative techniques and technologies into that solution; and finally to communicate that solution to colleagues, to professionals in other fields, and to the general public. Key to all of this is the ability of the problem-solver to work within a team environment throughout the entire problem-solving process.
