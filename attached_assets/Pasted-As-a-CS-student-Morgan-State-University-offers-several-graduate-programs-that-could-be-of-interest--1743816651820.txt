As a CS student, Morgan State University offers several graduate programs that could be of interest to you:

**In the Department of Computer Science:**

* **Master of Science (M.S.) in Advanced Computing (Online/Onsite):** This program focuses on emerging interdisciplinary areas within computer science, including **Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Cloud Computing.** It's offered both online and in person, with options for completing the degree through coursework only, or with a project or thesis. This program seems particularly well-suited if you want to specialize in these high-demand fields.
* **Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Advanced Computing:** This doctoral program delves into advanced areas of computer science research, including **Quantum Cryptography, Algorithms, Cybersecurity, AI/ML, and Data Analytics.** It also emphasizes responsible computing innovations. The program can be taken on campus or fully online/remote.
* **Master of Science (M.S.) in Bioinformatics:** This program provides coursework in computational biology methods, programming, and biostatistics. It offers flexibility through electives to specialize in life sciences and computer sciences, preparing graduates for the growing field of bioinformatics.

**Other potentially relevant graduate programs:**

* **Ph.D. in Interdisciplinary Engineering, Information, and Computational Sciences:** This program, while broader than just computer science, could offer opportunities for CS students interested in interdisciplinary research.
* **Master of Science (M.S.) in Data Analytics and Visualization:** Offered through the Department of Mathematics, this program could be of interest if you want to focus specifically on the data science aspects of computer science.
* **Master of Science (M.S.) in Electrical Engineering:** Depending on your specific interests within computer science (like computer architecture or embedded systems), this program in the Clarence M. Mitchell, Jr. School of Engineering might have relevant specializations.
